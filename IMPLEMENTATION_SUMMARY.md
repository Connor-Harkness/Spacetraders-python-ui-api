# Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation adds complete functionality to the contract buttons, ship buttons, and creates a new shipyard page as requested in issue #8.

## Changes Made

### 1. Contract Button Functionality ✅
**Files Modified:**
- `terminal_ui/widgets/contracts.py`
- `terminal_ui/app.py`

**Implementation:**
- Added message classes for contract actions (`ContractAccept`, `ContractFulfill`, `ContractAutomate`, `ContractDetails`)
- Added button click handler (`on_button_pressed`) to contract widget
- Added button IDs to properly identify which button was clicked
- Added app-level message handlers to perform actual API calls
- Integrated with existing automation system for contract automation

**Button Actions:**
- **Accept**: Calls `client.accept_contract(contract_id)` and refreshes data
- **Fulfill**: Calls `client.fulfill_contract(contract_id)` and refreshes data  
- **Automate**: Starts automation using existing `AutomationManager`
- **Details**: Shows contract details notification (extensible for future detailed view)

### 2. Ship Button Functionality ✅
**Files Modified:**
- `terminal_ui/widgets/ships.py`
- `terminal_ui/app.py`
- `spacetraders_client/client.py`

**Implementation:**
- Added message classes for ship actions (`ShipNavigate`, `ShipDock`, `ShipOrbit`, `ShipRefuel`, `ShipAutomate`)
- Added button click handler (`on_button_pressed`) to ship widget
- Added button IDs to properly identify which button was clicked
- Added app-level message handlers to perform actual API calls
- Implemented missing `refuel_ship` method in the client
- Integrated with existing automation system for ship automation

**Button Actions:**
- **Navigate**: Shows navigation notification (placeholder for future destination selection dialog)
- **Dock**: Calls `client.dock_ship(ship_symbol)` and refreshes data
- **Orbit**: Calls `client.orbit_ship(ship_symbol)` and refreshes data
- **Refuel**: Calls `client.refuel_ship(ship_symbol)` and refreshes data
- **Automate**: Starts automation using existing `AutomationManager`

### 3. Shipyard Page Functionality ✅
**Files Created/Modified:**
- `terminal_ui/widgets/shipyard.py` (new file)
- `terminal_ui/widgets/__init__.py`
- `terminal_ui/app.py`
- `terminal_ui/app.tcss`

**Implementation:**
- Created complete shipyard widget with system selection interface
- Added ship browsing functionality showing available ships with prices
- Added ship purchasing functionality
- Added shipyard refresh functionality
- Added new "Shipyard" tab to main application (keyboard shortcut: 'y')
- Added proper CSS styling for shipyard components
- Integrated with existing client methods (`get_shipyard`, `purchase_ship`, `get_system_waypoints`)

**Shipyard Features:**
- **System Selection**: Dropdown to select systems to browse
- **Ship Browsing**: View available ships with names, prices, and supply levels
- **Purchase Ships**: Buy ships directly from shipyards
- **Refresh**: Update shipyard inventory for specific shipyards or entire systems
- **Error Handling**: Proper error messages and recovery

### 4. Integration & Testing ✅
**Files Created:**
- `test_button_functionality.py`
- `test_manual.py` 
- `demo.py`
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`

**Implementation:**
- All new functionality integrates seamlessly with existing automation system
- Proper error handling and user feedback through notifications
- Automatic data refresh after successful actions
- Comprehensive tests to verify all functionality works correctly
- Manual testing with mock data to verify UI components
